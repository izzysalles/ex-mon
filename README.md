## Introduction

ExMon is a turn-based pokemon game made with Elixir. This is a project from a Elixir's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/elixir-e-phoenix-do-zero). :books:
 
 ## How it works
 
- The human and the computer starts with 100 health points. 

- Each round, each one can make one of the 3 moves:

  - Moderate attack that does between (18-25) damage;
  - Varied attack that deals between (10-35) damage;
  - Healing power, healing between (18-25) life.

- If the player or the computer has 0 health, the game is over. ðŸ’¥
